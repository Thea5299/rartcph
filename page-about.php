              <h3>ABOUT RART</h3>
              <p>Hi, my name is Anna and I am the founder of RART CPH. I started RART CPH because I had an urge to create, and instantly fell in love with tufting. I wanted to create something new, and something that wasn’t done before, so I started making mirrors with tufted frames. Later on, I extended with rugs, and love the different possibilities in both pieces.
 
 I get my inspiration from everywhere - from a walk in the forest to a trip down Nørrebrogade. I love coming to Møn where I first had my workshop. Here I get most of my inspiration, and it is also here I by most of my materials from local shops.
  
 Every piece is designed and handmade by me. It is unique and made to last. I use a lot of time on every piece and put all my love into each and every one and down to the smallest details.

          <h3>TUFTING</h3>
              <p>Every piece is tufted by hand with a tufting gun. Every time I create a new piece, I put up a tufting cloth which functions as a big canvas. I use two kind of tufting guns - one which makes u-shapet loops and a cut-gun which cuts the yarn. Every piece is made on the backside of the canvas, so it is always exciting to look at the front once in a while during the making of a piece.
</p>
              <h3>SUSTAINABILITY</h3>
              <p>Sustainability was a priority from the get go. It was important to me that approximately 80% off my yarn was recycled. Even though it is cheaper and easier to find new yarn in shops, I started searching for a sustainable alternative. I found a local dealer, who buys yarn from the fashion industry’s waste in Italy, Spain and France. This is where most of my yarn is from because of the cause and quality.
I mostly use wool and alpaca wool to get the best possible quality that last.
